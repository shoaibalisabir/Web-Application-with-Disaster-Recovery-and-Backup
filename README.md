## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to implement a robust disaster recovery and backup strategy for a to-do application. By using AWS services, this solution ensures that user data is consistently backed up and can be restored quickly in the event of a failure.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS RDS (MySQL)**: For managing the database.
- **AWS S3**: For storing manual snapshots and backups.
- **AWS Lambda**: For creating on-demand RDS snapshots.
- **AWS Backup**: For managing backup plans and schedules.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring and alerts.

## Architecture

1. **Frontend**: A web interface built for managing tasks.
2. **Backend**: Microservices handling CRUD operations and user authentication.
3. **Database**: AWS RDS (MySQL) instance for storing tasks and user data.
4. **Backup**: Automated backups configured for daily snapshots with AWS Backup.

## Features

- Automated daily backups of the RDS instance.
- Manual snapshot creation via AWS Lambda function.
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and failover.
- Monitoring and alerting setup via AWS CloudWatch.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app-backup-solution.git
   cd todo-app-backup-solution
   ```

2. **Set up AWS RDS (MySQL)**:
   - Create an RDS instance with MySQL.
   - Configure the security groups and ensure access to your application.

3. **Create an S3 bucket for backups:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-backup-bucket-name
   ```

4. **Configure AWS Backup**:
   - Set up backup plans using the AWS CLI or Management Console.

5. **Deploy the application**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `frontend` and `backend` directories to set up and run the application.

## Usage

- Access the to-do application via your preferred web browser.
- Use the provided features to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Monitor backup statuses and restore processes through AWS Console.
